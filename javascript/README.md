# JavaScript Palindrome

This contains a dead-simple JavaScript implementation of a palindrome checker.

For shits and giggles, there is also a fully-functional version that is _somehow_ obfuscated following the ideas of [JSFuck](http://www.jsfuck.com/).

## Run tests

Install dev dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

When this is done, you can use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to run the test suite (for both implementations, actually)

```bash
npm test
```

## Using this implementation

If you want to integrate this as a proper UMD module, for example: Feel free 😘

I, however, was too lazy to set up a webpack build with multiple compilation targets 😏
